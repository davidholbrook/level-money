# Level Money

This is an Nextron-based application that is loosely based on Kaikabo and built to make saving money simple and easy.

_**Disclaimer:** Level Money is not financial advice or any science-backed way of saving money. It is just something that I use and want to share with others._

This application is still in active development and missing many essential features, such as adding a spending limit and auto-clearing monthly transactions. Instructions for use are coming soon!
